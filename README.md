## Description

This is a simple text-based Blackjack (21) game developed in C. The game simulates the popular card game where players attempt to achieve a hand value closest to 21 without exceeding it, competing against a dealer. The game includes the following features:

- **Card Drawing**: Both player and dealer draw cards, with face cards (Jack, Queen, King) worth 10 points and Ace worth either 1 or 11.
- **Betting System**: Players place a bet using their available chips before each round.
- **Statistics**: Player stats, including wins, losses, ties, and total chips, are saved in an SQLite database.
- **Win/Loss Analysis**: View your win/loss/tie ratios after each game session.
- **Persistent Player State**: Saves and loads player data (chips, games played, wins, losses, ties) between sessions.

This game was created to practice basic C programming skills, including handling user input, implementing game logic, and working with databases.

## Installation

    ```

    This will start the game in your terminal. You will be prompted to place bets and play against the dealer.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **C Programming Language** (v11.2.0)
- **SQLite** for database management (v3.36)
- **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection) for compiling C code

## Features

Key features of the Blackjack game include:

- **Single-player** gameplay against a computer-controlled dealer.
- **Database Integration** to store player data (chips, wins, losses, ties).
- **Betting System** allowing players to place bets each round.
- **Real-time Feedback** after each round showing the outcome and updated stats.
- **Win/Loss/Tie Analysis** showing the playerâ€™s win/loss ratio.
- **Persistent Player State** saved and loaded between game sessions.

## Usage Information

This game is intended to be played via the terminal:

1. **Start the Game**: After launching, the game will display your current chip count and ask you to place a bet.
2. **Player's Turn**: You can choose to "hit" (draw a card) or "stand" (end your turn). The dealer automatically plays according to Blackjack rules (draws until reaching at least 17).
3. **Game Outcome**: The result of each round (win, loss, or tie) will be shown, and your chip count will be updated.
4. **View Statistics**: You can view your win/loss/tie ratios and total games played.
5. **Save & Resume**: Player data is saved after each session, and the next time you launch the game, your stats will be automatically loaded.
