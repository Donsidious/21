Description

This application is a simple text based Blackjack game built using the C programming language. The game allows the player to play against a dealer in a standard 21 game, where the goal is to have a higher hand value than the dealer without exceeding 21.

The game tracks player statistics such as total chips, wins, losses, ties, and total games played, which are saved using an SQLite database. Players can also view their win/loss ratio after each session.

The game is designed to be played in the terminal, and the player can choose to "hit" (draw a card) or "stand" (end their turn). A series of rules for busting (going over 21) and winning conditions are implemented for both the player and the dealer.
